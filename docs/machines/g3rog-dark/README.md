## Notes

- The showcase HTML is the best first link for friends and visitors.
- The detailed HTML and markdown are useful for maintenance, audits, and future comparison.
- The detailed source contains operational context. Keep it reviewed for private details before publishing outside the repo.
- SMT is restored to Auto / enabled; the 2026-05-09 sanitized source confirms 8 physical cores and 16 logical processors.
- Memory was observed at DDR5-6200 with 32-38-38-80 1T timing. Keep stability testing notes with this machine if that profile stays.
- Exact M.2 physical slot mapping still needs verification because SMBIOS slot occupancy does not fully match the detected NVMe inventory.
- One Samsung 860 EVO has a high historical C7 CRC counter; check whether it continues increasing before blaming the SSD itself.
- Avoid using the X870E Dark Hero M.2 slot that trades bandwidth with rear USB4 unless that tradeoff is intentional.

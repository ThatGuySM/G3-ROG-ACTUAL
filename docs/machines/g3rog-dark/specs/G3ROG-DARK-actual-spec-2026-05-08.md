## Thermal and Power Baseline

This is not a stress-test result. It is a point-in-time AIDA64 sensor snapshot from the uploaded hardware report. Values below reflect the 2026-05-09 sanitized source refresh.

| Sensor | Reading |
| --- | --- |
| Motherboard | 37 C |
| CPU | 50 C |
| CPU package | 60 C |
| VRM | 46 C |
| RTX 5090 GPU | 33 C |
| RTX 5090 memory | 44 C |
| Crucial T705 2TB | 53 C |
| Crucial T705 1TB | 43 C |
| AIO pump | 3524 RPM |
| RTX 5090 fan #1 / #2 | 619 RPM / 620 RPM |
| Board-estimated system power | 274.02 W |

## Operational Notes

- The uploaded AIDA64 reports are the source of truth for the installed G3ROG-DARK build.
- The old g3ROG-actual spec sheet is now historical and should not be treated as current for this machine.
- SMT is restored to Auto / enabled; the 2026-05-09 sanitized source confirms 8 physical cores and 16 logical processors.
- Memory is running above the kit's original DDR5-6000 spec at DDR5-6200 CL32-38-38-80 1T. Keep stability notes with future updates.
- Exact M.2 physical slot mapping still needs verification because SMBIOS slot occupancy does not fully match the two detected Gen5 NVMe controllers.
- One Samsung 860 EVO has a high historical C7 CRC counter; check whether it is still increasing before treating it as drive failure.
- X870E Dark Hero M.2_2 shares bandwidth with rear USB4 40Gbps ports. Avoid filling that slot unless the tradeoff is intentional.
- Use the proper native high-power GPU cable path for the RTX 5090.
